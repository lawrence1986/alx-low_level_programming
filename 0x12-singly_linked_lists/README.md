# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

This is a TEAM Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. The objective of this project is to inderstand the concept about linked lists vs arrays and how to use and build linked lists in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
