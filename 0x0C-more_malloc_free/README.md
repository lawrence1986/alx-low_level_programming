# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free


Project done by Lawrence Maduabuchi during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School** **Cohort-13**. It aims to learn about malloc (Memory Allocation) in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ` 0-malloc_checked.c` | Write a function that allocates memory using malloc|
| ` 1-string_nconcat.c` | Write a function that concatenates two strings.|
| ` 2-calloc.c` | Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc|
| ` 3-array_range.c` | Write a function that creates an array of integers|
| ` 100-realloc.c` | Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free|
| ` 101-mul.c` | Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.|
