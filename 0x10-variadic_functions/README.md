0x10. C - Variadic functions


Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. In this task we would learn What are variadic functions, how to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros. Would also learn why and how to use the const type qualifier **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiled by: Lawrence Maduabuchi – Cohort 13

All of the following files are programs written in C: 
GitHub Repository: alx-low_level_programming
