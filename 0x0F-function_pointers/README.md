0x0F. C - Function pointers


Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. What are function pointers, What does a function pointer do exactly, Where does a function pointer point to in virtual memory **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiled by: Lawrence Maduabuchi â€“ Cohort 13


## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |

| ` 0-print_name.c` | Write a function that prints a name. Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));|
| ` 1-array_iterator.c` | Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. |
| ` 2-int_index.c` | Write a function that searches for an integer. |
| ` 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h` | Write a program that performs simple operations, Usage: calc num1 operator num2|
