# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor


Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about What are macros and how to use them, What are the most common predefined macros & How to include guard in your header files in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiled by: Lawrence Maduabuchi â€“ Cohort 13


## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ` 0-object_like_macro.h` | Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.|
| ` 1-pi.h` | Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.|
| ` 2-main.c` | Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.|
| ` 3-function_like_macro.h` | Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.|
| ` 4-sum.h` | Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.|
